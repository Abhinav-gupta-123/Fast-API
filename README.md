## 📝 Why I'm Doing This

As a passionate AIML enthusiast currently in my learning phase, I believe that:

> "Learning is best when shared."

So I’m documenting **each step** of my journey here, with clean code, comments, and explanations. I hope this helps students, developers, and anyone starting their journey in API development.

### ✅ Tips to Use This:

1. **Replace placeholders** like `yourusername`, `yourprofile`, and URLs with your actual links.
2. Update the **project table** and **updates log** regularly as you add new folders and features.
3. If you're adding ML APIs, be sure to include:
   - Input/output formats (JSON examples)
   - Model name, type
   - `.pkl` file usage
   - FastAPI route explanations
