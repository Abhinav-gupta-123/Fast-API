# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Journey - From Scratch to Advanced

Welcome to my FastAPI learning repository! 🎯  
This repo is a complete, hands-on journey where I share everything I'm learning about building APIs using **FastAPI** – starting from the very basics and moving towards real-world, production-ready projects.  

Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate learner looking to master FastAPI, you're in the right place. Let’s learn and grow together! 🌱

## 📝 Why I'm Doing This

As a passionate AIML enthusiast currently in my learning phase, I believe that:

> "Learning is best when shared."

So I’m documenting **each step** of my journey here, with clean code, comments, and explanations. I hope this helps students, developers, and anyone starting their journey in API development.
